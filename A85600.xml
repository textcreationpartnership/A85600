            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION Of Colonell HORTON AND The Officers and Soulders under his Command.</head>
            <p>THe Honorable Houſes of Parliament having reſolved that the forces under the command of Maj. Gen. Laug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn ſhould be disbanded. And for the ſpeeding of that work, his Excellency the Lord Gen. iſsued forth his poſitive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Commander in chief of thoſe Forces, for the disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the forces in South-Wales. But Col. <hi>Rice Powel</hi> with his Forces (after many ſolemn and publike engagements of his ſubmiſſion to the Ordinances of Parliament, and his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies orders for disbanding) doth now contrary to the ſaid Orders
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161664:3"/>and ingagements, not only refuſe to disband, but earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to lay the foundation of a new war, the which that he may the better accompliſh, he doth entertain all ſuch ſouldiers formerly disbanded, as by any fair promiſes he can allure unto him, labouring to increaſe his number, to the great charge of the Inhabitants, and not reſting there, iſsueth forth his warrants to ſummon the Countries to ſeverall Randezvouz, attempting thereby to ingage them in a deſperate deſign, to the manifest hazard of ſpilling the bloud, and unavoidable ruining the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of his Neighbors and Country men.</p>
            <p>And yet would perſwade the people, he only intends to oppoſe new Forces drawing towards them, as he ſuggeſts, to indanger their peace, though occaſioned by his and his adherents disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Parliament and his Excellencies orders to come to eaſe the Country of the burden of free quarter.</p>
            <p>Therefore we thought fit (for a prevention of the miſeries, theſe deluſions may lead the Country men into) to declare and publiſh, that the true reaſons of theſe forces marching into theſe Counties, are no other, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And then after eaſing the Country of theſe heavy burdens; they will ſuddenly depart again, hoping in the mean time, to prevent the inconveniencies that formerly accompanied Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Let therefore all well meaning people timely take heed of being divided by faire tales to ruine themſelves, and ſeriouſly conſider the different fruits of war and peace. It is the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace the Parliament endeavours through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is no where disturbed but in theſe parts, And by whom, it is here done, and upon what grounds and pretences, we
